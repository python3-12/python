Images and sound

To load a sound, just use pygame.mixer.init().
Then skip a few lines and put a variable equal to pygame.mixer.sound(“”) and inside the quatation marks put the path to the sound you downloaded.
Then, when you want to play the sound, just say the name of the variable that you just defined.play().

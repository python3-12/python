first make a class like this:

class Player(turtle.Turtle):
    def __init__(self,spriteshape,color,x,y):
            turtle.Turtle.__init__(self,shape = spriteshape)
            self.speed(0)
            self.penup()
            self.color(color)
            self.fd(0)
            self.goto(x,y)
            self.speed = 1

second make a variable like this that is outside the class:

player = Player("classic","aqua",0,0)
  
third make a def that is like this outside of the class:
def move_right():
  x = player.x -= 50
  player.set_x(x)

to detect key presses, use:
turtle.onkeypress()
you can also use:
turtle.onkey()
the difference of them is that "onkey" is where you have to click the key, take stop clicking the key, then click it again to make
it where you move more then once. "onkeypress" is a thing where you can hold down the key so that you move more than once.
in each one the first line of code inside the perantacies is the def, the next line of code is the key you want to be used.
for the arrow keys, they all are first letter uppercase, but the rest have all lowercase.

if this is common problem that is a quick fix.
this is one way it can happen:
result = "string" + 5
the reason it will give you this error is because you can't add a string to a number, like
if someone asked you what 1 + me equals, it would be very confusing.

the way to fix it is by doing this:
result = "string" + str(5)
this is telling the computer to add the word five and string.

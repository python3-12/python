  
make a def that is like this outside of the class:
def move_right():
  x = player.xcor
  x += 50
  player.setx(x)
what this is doing is saying, if I say move_right(), that means to make a variable equal to the player's x, then saying add fifty to the players x, and then player.setx(x) is 
saying, now set the variable x as the players x coridanants

to detect key presses, use:
turtle.onkeypress()
you can also use:
turtle.onkey()
the difference of them is that "onkey" is where you have to click the key, take stop clicking the key, then click it again to make
it where you move more then once. "onkeypress" is a thing where you can hold down the key so that you move more than once.
in each one the first line of code inside the perantacies is the def, the next line of code is the key you want to be used.
for the arrow keys, they all are first letter uppercase, but the rest have all lowercase.

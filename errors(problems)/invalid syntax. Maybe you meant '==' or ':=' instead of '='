this just means you put only one equals sighn when you were supposed to put two.
for example if I put only one equals sighn for an if and don't put a greater than, less than, or equal sighn after it.
the way you can fix this is put a greater than, less than, or equal sighn after the first equal sighn.
this will not happen if you only put a greater than sighn or only put a less than sighn.

to make your turtle window appear, you can use a variable equal to(i'm using wn):
turtle.Screen()
next, say the name of the variable and then a dot like this:
wn.
say this three times like this:
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("blue")
wn.title("teaching")
wn.setup(700,700)

wn.bgcolor tells it "I want this to be whatever color"
here are some possible colors:
red, green, blue, cyan, as well as options like lightgreen, turquoise, skyblue

wn.title tells it I want to name this "whatever you put here" 
the title is shown on the top of the window when it pops up,it's defalt is "python turtle graphics"

wn.setup tells it I want the size of this screen to be this many by this many pixels

to create the screen, you need three lines of code.

The first two are very important!
The first line is just importing pygame.
The second line is just to initialize pygame, to do this just write pygame.init()
The third line of code is making a variable equal to pygame.display.set_mode(())
Inside those the perantacies inside the perantacies, write how big you want your screen to be for exemple if I wrote:
pygame.display.set_mode((500,300))
then my screen would be 500 by 300 pixels big!

This next line of code is optional, if you want to give your screen a name, then write:
pygame.display.set_caption("whatever you want it to be named")
this will pop up on the top of the screen. If you don't do it, then it will be called pygame window.

This line of code is also optional, if you want to change the picture on the top left corner of the screen from a frog to something else, just
write:
pygame.display.set_icon("the path to the picture you want at the top left corner of the screen")

it was a good old day at the pycity, terminal screaming at people, print yapping, and input taking peoples orders at yumma perantacie.
yumma perantacie is a place where you can buy perantacies for very cheap, infact, it only cost 8pybux. pybux are money in pycity.
not only could you order perantacies at yumma perantacie you can put stuff inside of the perantacies! like if I wanted
some string or strings in it, I could put some in it for 50pycent more! if I wanted to have some numbers in it today, then I could put intigers in it
for only 50pycent, pycent are cents in pycity.
and if I wanted a stronger string taste or a stronger integer taste, then they can sprinkel some str or int sause on it for only 3pybux more!
Oh, and you are probaly wondering what is candy in pycity, well it is called plusequals!
the most unhealthy plusequals is 99!
everything in pycity had a variable that equals zero, than they would have a while loop saying that while that variable
is less than one hundred, than everything is okay, but it had a if statement that said that if you eat plusequals than your variable gets bigger by the 
amount of unhealthy the plusequals is! and if that variable gets to a hundred, then break would get alerted and come break the while loop wich makes
you die! But, yup pretty scary, prettey pretty scary. anyway, their is one thing that was not going well, and that is that os.system is on the loose!
os.system is bassicaly this guy that can make it where you can answer any command to an input, and that means that if a hacker answered something that
took over the computer, then pycity could be used for bad! so yup, it is a "good old day", so a "good old day". hey narrator, said pycity's marror, how come you said
that it was a good old day, no quetation marks before? cause I didn't ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. wait, what?, said pycitys marror. that could only mean that os.system kidnapped input,then
used him and ran to a hacker! alert! alert! hacker attacking! hacker attacking! take cover! 
that was the hacker alert!
input!! yelled print, nooooo

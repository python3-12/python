this just means that you imported something that python could not find.
there are two ways to this can happen, you either tried to import a module that doesn't exist, or you imported a module that you need to pip install.
if you imported a module that doesn't exist, it is possible that you just misspelled, so resspell it. otherwise, that module doesn't exist and errase it.

if you need to pip install it, just go into your terminal and write:

pip install the name of the module you need to install

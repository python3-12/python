if you want to make your program faster than put the name of the window variable.tracer() or turtle.tracer()
zero is the fastest
put the number in like this:
variable_name.tracer(0)
or like this:
turtle.tracer(0)
you must put:
wn.update()
at the first line of your while loop for it to work though, other wise it crashes.
